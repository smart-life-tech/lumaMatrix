# MAX7219 LED Matrix Array with Raspberry Pi

This project demonstrates how to connect and control multiple MAX7219 LED matrix modules using a Raspberry Pi. The MAX7219 is an integrated serial input/output common-cathode display driver that connects microprocessors to 7-segment numeric LED displays of up to 8 digits, bar-graph displays, or 64 individual LEDs. By cascading multiple MAX7219 modules, larger LED displays can be created and controlled with fewer GPIO pins.

## Hardware Setup

### Components Needed

- Raspberry Pi (any model with GPIO pins)
- MAX7219 LED matrix modules (8x8 or 8x32, quantity as needed)
- Jumper wires
- Power supply capable of providing sufficient current for the LED modules (e.g., 5V, 2.56A for 8 modules)

### Wiring Instructions

1. **Connect VCC and GND:**
   - Connect the VCC (5V) pin of each MAX7219 module to the 5V pin of the Raspberry Pi.
   - Connect the GND pin of each MAX7219 module to a GND pin of the Raspberry Pi.

2. **Connect DIN, CS, and CLK:**
   - Choose separate GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi for each MAX7219 module according to the attached image in the repo.
   - Connect the DIN (Data In), CS (Chip Select), and CLK (Clock) pins of each MAX7219 module to the chosen GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi.

### Power Supply Considerations

- Each MAX7219 module can draw up to 320mA when all LEDs are lit.
- Calculate the total current requirement based on the number of modules connected.
- Use a power supply capable of providing at least the calculated current requirement to avoid issues with insufficient power.

## Software Setup

### Installation

1. Ensure your Raspberry Pi is connected to the internet.
2. Open a terminal window on the Raspberry Pi.
3. Install the `luma.led_matrix` library by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install luma.led_matrix
   ```

### Configuration

1. Define the GPIO pins for each MAX7219 module in your Python code.
2. Write Python code to initialize and control the LED matrices using the `luma.led_matrix` library.

## Usage

1. Connect the hardware components according to the wiring instructions.
2. Run your Python code on the Raspberry Pi.
3. The LED matrices should display the desired output as programmed.
